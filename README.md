Please review and make suggestions, either by opening an Issue or creating a Pull Request.

The FCC deadline is 10 October 2024. https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-22-86A1.pdf

Excerpted from the FCC document:

68. Machine-Readable Format. We require providers to make the information included in
the label available to the public in machine-readable format.142 By “machine readable,” we mean
providing “data in a format that can be easily processed by a computer without human intervention while
ensuring no semantic meaning is lost.”143 Providers should make each label’s information available by
providing the information separately in a spreadsheet file format such as .csv. These files should be made
available on a provider’s website via a dedicated URL that contains all of a provider’s given labels. We
require providers to publicize the URL with the label data in the transparency disclosures required under
47 CFR § 8.1(a). These machine-readable files must provide the same categories of information as those
presented in each label, including the unique identifier described below. We direct CGB, in consultation
with other relevant bureaus, to make available on the Commission’s website resources that may help
providers satisfy the machine-readability requirement, such as sample machine-readable spreadsheet
files.144 Further, given the importance of this requirement, we will monitor providers’ implementation of
machine readability to ensure providers’ implementation of this requirement is useful to third parties and
the Commission in its data collection efforts.

69. Although section 60504 of the Infrastructure Act does not expressly address the format
requirements for broadband labels, implementing broadband labels with a machine-readability
requirement advances the statutory objective of providing consumers with sufficient key information
needed to evaluate broadband Internet access service plans in a manner that is available when they need it
and most effective for them.145 We agree with commenters that making the label information machine
readable will yield a number of benefits to consumers. For example, machine readability will enable third
parties to more easily collect and aggregate data for the purpose of creating comparison-shopping tools
for consumers.146 These tools may include browser add-ons or websites that compare plans offered by
different providers.147 Making the information machine readable also helps ensure that the data third
parties use is both accurate and up to date. Because providers often “adjust . . . [their] business
offerings,” we believe it may be simpler for them to “re-enter the new information and re-upload [their]
labels” in a machine-readable format.148

71. Machine readability also promotes both competition as well as transparency and
accountability. Consumers may use the data collected in this manner to compare typical speeds reported
by subscribers versus those reported on a broadband label.149 And, as AARP explains, the generation of
shopping tools like these helps promote “digital equity” for groups lacking the necessary expertise to
parse what is often complicated language contained in service agreements.150 These tools can assist such
groups, including older Americans, to more easily obtain the information they need to select the service
plan that best meets their needs.151

71. Further, requiring ISPs to post machine-readable label information will allow the
Commission to more easily collect data about broadband markets.152 Information collected via machinereadable labels may also make monitoring for compliance with Commission rules and enforcement more efficient as well.153 A machine-readable label could, for instance, help determine if “a provider has
published [a] properly formatted label . . . online.”154

72. While each of the foregoing benefits would be sufficient to persuade us to adopt this
requirement, we further observe that a machine-readability requirement will make data more easily
available for research as well.155 As New America’s Open Institute of Technology explains, broadband
affordability research that is reliant on manual review of existing provider advertising can be a “timeconsuming and laborious process that many organizations are unable to undertake.”156 The Institute for Local Self-Reliance, which itself has “been forced to abandon research projects because of the industry’s
information gaps,” observes that the broadband consumer label provides “an excellent opportunity to
facilitate research efforts” by “allow[ing] researchers to aggregate data at a large scale and analyze this
data.”157 Such research can serve industry, policymakers, consumers, and advocacy groups by providing a
clearer picture of the marketplace.158

73. The record shows that these benefits can be achieved at a low cost to providers, with no
commenters providing cost data to suggest otherwise.159 We agree with AARP that making the broadband
consumer label data machine readable does not impose a high burden or require special technical
expertise.160 We find ACA Connect’s argument that such a requirement would “tax the resources of small
providers with limited in-house technical resources” unpersuasive, as they fail to elaborate why or
substantiate their claim with any evidence.161 Further, we do not believe that publishing the label
information in a spreadsheet file would impose a high technical burden. And as noted above, the
Commission will offer resources to ease compliance with this requirement.
74. We disagree with commenters that argue that requiring the label to be machine readable
creates difficulties for providers because of “information on the label [that] cannot be boiled down to a
binary response.”162 First, commenters opposed to machine readability fail to describe what kind of
information is lost and how that may impact consumer choice.163 NCTA only cites descriptions of onetime fees as an example where oversimplification may be required.164 However, NCTA does not explain how “semantic meaning is lost” or what inaccuracies might be introduced.165 To the extent that providers
request “flexibility” to provide additional information in the label not required by the Commission,166
information that may not be easily reducible to binary responses, we note that this is not the label’s
purpose. Indeed, to the extent that machine readability promotes “apples-to-apples” comparisons that do
not reflect every nuance that differentiates plans,167 we agree with AARP that this does not necessarily
represent a flaw.168 One of the goals of the broadband consumer label is to simplify the process of
comparison shopping and make the most critical information readily available to consumers.169 Thus, we
agree with AARP that conveying the type of information opponents argue may not be picked up by a
program “is secondary to label data needed to make apples-to-apples comparisons.”170 We also agree
with commenters that the benefits outlined above outweigh these concerns over flexibility.171

75. NTCA and WISPA’s invocation of the nutrition label model, which they argue “is not
designed to serve as [an] on-ramp to electronic comparison shopping,”172 to oppose a machine-readability
requirement also proves unconvincing. Nothing about a machine-readability requirement undermines the
broadband consumer label’s ability to provide “rapid and comprehensible comparison among
products.”173 Simultaneously, shopping for broadband is a more involved process than purchasing a food
product. It involves selection of a service that normally requires ongoing, periodic payments, that may
involve a contract, and that impacts various facets of an individual’s life.174 Such a choice reasonably 
takes more time and research than that spent in a food aisle, making NTCA and WISPA’s comparison in
this regard inapt.

76. We also disagree with AT&T’s assertion that machine readability is not “designed to help
the consumer at the point of sale but rather to facilitate third parties’ desire to conduct various forms of
research or analysis,” which AT&T claims is “not the purpose of the labels.”175 As described above,
machine readability enhances the point-of-sale experience in a variety of ways, including in the form of
third-party shopping comparison tools. While AT&T claims that machine readability “could fatally
compromise broadband providers’ ability to . . . convey accurate information on the labels,”176 AT&T
does not elaborate as to how. To the extent that machine readability fails to capture all the benefits of a
given plan, we agree with Consumer Reports that the Commission can expect “the creativity of ISPs” will
lead to solutions for “further explain[ing] the details of their service offerings to appeal to a wide range of
audiences.”177

77. We recognize, however, that the Commission did not include a machine-readability
requirement in 2016 and that this will take some additional effort. We therefore delay compliance with
this requirement until one year after the Office of Management and Budget completes its review of this
new information collection.

78. Unique Plan Identifiers. We require ISPs to develop unique identifiers for each of their
plans and attach them to the broadband label. The unique identifier should consist of a unique ID for
fixed plan or mobile plan (“F” for fixed plans and “M” for mobile plans), followed by the broadband
provider’s FCC Registration Number,178 and ending with a provider-chosen string of precisely 15
alphanumeric characters uniquely identifying the specific plan within the broadband provider’s offerings.
The Unique Plan Identifier shall not include special characters such as, &, *, and %. For example, AT&T
could specify a fixed broadband offering as F + 0005937974 + 123ABC456DEF789. This would appear
on the label as F0005937974123ABC456DEF789. Unique identifiers should be sufficiently distinctive so
that third parties and the Commission can identify the specific plan identified by the unique identifier.179
Additionally, reuse of identifiers must not occur; even if a given plan is no longer offered, its string
should not be repurposed for a new or different plan.

79. Unique identifiers are useful for a variety of purposes. For example, use of a unique
identifier would enable ISPs, which often change their plan offerings, to reuse a given plan’s name
without creating confusion. While NCTA argues that unique identifiers are unnecessary for this purpose,
they do not describe the “significant burdens” they claim would be imposed.180 USTelecom notes that
requiring provider-created unique identifiers would not “creat[e] undue burden on providers or increas[e]
administrative costs.”181

80. Additionally, unique identifiers may be helpful in reducing ambiguity in other contexts as
well. Third-party shopping tools might benefit from ISPs’ use of unique identifiers. And researchers
may find it helpful having a shared, consistent means of identifying ISPs’ plans as opposed to use of
descriptive language that could result in confusion about which plan is being discussed.

be enabled by the Commission providing an API for inputting data, or by providing a template in Excel format, to
allow the creation of information in both .csv and .xml formats and the machine-readable format requirement should
impose no significant burden on the ISP).

145 Infrastructure Act § 60504. We thus find Lumen’s statutory assertions unavailing. See Lumen Comments at 13
(arguing that making label information machine readable “is clearly not something the Infrastructure Act
mandates”). Although we impose a machine-readability requirement and require that providers associate their plans
with a unique identifier, we do not address issues related to any information collection required under sec. 60502(c)
of the Infrastructure Act. Such issues remain pending in WC Docket No. 21-450. See Affordable Connectivity
Program, WC Docket No. 21-450, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, FCC 22-44 (rel. June 8, 2022).

163 While we acknowledge that information obtained by consumers, such as from third-party price aggregators, may
not fully reflect all the costs and benefits of a given plan, this wider criticism applies to the use of a broadband
consumer label generally and is not specific to a machine-readability requirement.

178 Providers must use the FCC Registration Number that is used when submitting data to the Broadband Data
Collection.

179 ISPs might consider use of other indicators, such as a ZIP Code of where the plan is offered, to set their
identifiers apart. See Fields and Miller Comments at 1-2.
