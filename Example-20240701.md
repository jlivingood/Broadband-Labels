# Definition of Format

This section follows the use of case sensitivity 
described in RFC 8174:

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
      NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED",
      "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
      described in BCP 14 [^RFC2119] [^RFC8174] when, and only when, they
      appear in all capitals, as shown here

## File Type

There are a variety of potential file types that could be used, such as CSV, XML, JSON, and others. Of all of the options, it appears that a Comma Separates Value (CSV) [^RFC4180] file is the most uniformly understood and easiest to use. For one, most people know how to use a CSV file or have access to software that will automatically figure out how to open a CSV file. One downside may be that while a CSV file is universally known - it's difficult to extend a CSV file, since calculations are often built on fixed column - not by looking up the column header name or description. That can be mitigated to some extent by building in as many optional fields as we can conceive of in the first version, and by creating an accompanying data dictionary file that explains and defines each field, but is certainly a downside to using a CSV. 

[^RFC4180]: See https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc4180.

On the other hand, JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is also well-known in the research and technical communities and can be human-readable rather than just values separated by commas. There is also software that can convert a JSON file to a CSV file (REF NEEDED -- NICK TO ADD), and it is easily extensible. 

Based on the widespread use of CSV files, it seems this is the primary file that should be made available. ISPs can of course optionally consider generating a JSON file or other file types. 

## File Format
The CSV file uses the "text/csv" media (MIME) type [^RFC6838], which is defined in the IANA registry of MIME types [^IANACSV]. 

The character encoding of the CSV file MUST be UTF-8. 

When served over HTTP, the most common use case, the media type used in the Content-Type header MUST have 
the parameter of "charset=utf-8".

[^RFC6838]: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6838.html
[^IANACSV]: https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/text/csv

### Format Guidelines Conform to RFC 4180
The format of the published CSV MUST adhere to RFC 4180 [^RFC4180]. 

That RFC defines several key formatting requirements, 
especially in Section 2, which requires close reading my operators. This covers things like how to use 
line breaks (a.k.a. "Carriage Return, Line Feed" - CRLF). This RFC 4180 format can be imported into recent versions 
of Microsoft Excel and LibreOffice, as well as other software clients.

This standard format also allows operators to use quotes and line-breaks within fields, as needed. 

[^RFC4180]: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4180.html

The schema also follows the proposed standard guidelines in the U.K. National Archives CSV Schema 
Language version 1.2 [^githubCSV]. 

[^githubCSV]: https://digital-preservation.github.io/csv-schema/csv-schema-1.2.html.

### File Header Required
The CSV file MUST contain a header row. In addition, when served over HTTP (the most common case), the 
media-type used in the Content-Type HTTP header MUST have the parameter of "header=present".

While a file header is not strictly required for CSV files as defined in RFC 4180, it is required here 
because it provides a firm definition of field names without having to consult a separate file for this information.

The file header will appear on the first line of the file and will include each field name, separated by commas and 
ending with a line break (i.e., field_name,field_name,field_name CRLF). 

### Schema Version 1
This is the first version of the schema, version 1. Subsequent versions will increase one integer at a time,
from 1 to 2, and so on. The schema version MUST be listed in the media type of the file.

For example, "text/csv;header=present;charset=utf-8;schema-version=bblabel-1", with the "bblabel-1" part representing the first version of the broadband label schema. The second, when/if defined, would be "bblabel-2", then "bblabel-3" for the third, and so on.

Note: This document attempts to define a number of both required and optional fields. This is being done in a way to 
try to think to future needs and a variety of uses, because adding fields means adding columns to the definition of 
the CSV schema, and thus the definition of a new schema version.

### One Row is One Broadband Label
Each row represents a distinct broadband label and is delimited in the CSV file with a line break. 

## Format of File Name

Underscore characters and spaces MUST NOT be used in the file name.

The file name MUST follow this standard format in the order below. 

1. Date when published, in the ISO 8601 format [^ISO8601], with hyphens. Thus the format is YYYY-MM-DD, so 
2025-01-15 for example to represent January 15, 2025.

[^ISO8601]: See https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html.

2. Autonomous System Number [^ASN] OR FCC Registration Number (FRN) [^FCCFRN], up to 10 digits max length. 

3. Country Code, using the International Organization for Standardization 
(ISO) ISO 3166-3 format. This the "Alpha-3" code â€“ a three-letter code that represents a country name, which is usually more closely related to the country name than the two-letter code. For example, the United States of America is USA and Canada is CAN. [^CC]

[^CC]: See https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html.

4. The provider MAY optionally include additional information in the field name (see the use of "ABCD" below). 
For example, the file might include "mobile" or "5g-fwa" in the name. 

Examples (non-exclusive): 2025-01-15-7922-USA.csv, 2025-01-15-7922-USA-ABCD.csv, 2025-01-15-0005937974-USA-mobile.csv


## File Contents
The file MUST contain the required fields. There are several optional fields which MAY also be included by 
providers. All these fields are all detailed below. If additional fields are defined in the future, the schema 
will need to be updated.

If any field does not apply, whether required or optional, then it MUST be left empty (null). 

All examples are non-exclusive.

### Required Fields
 
1. Regulator Name

Initially this will only be the FCC, but as it is possible that other regulators may wish to use this format, a 
regulator field is included.
This field MUST be in the file and MAY be used. If this field is empty, users of the file SHOULD assume the regulator is the FCC.

Name: regulator_name

Type/Format: string

Examples: FCC, OFCOM, ECOI, MIC
  
2. Regulator Version Number
   
If requirements ever change, as we expect they will, having a required version field will be very useful. Given that labels must be maintained historically, it will be useful to know that a particular historical or current label is compatible with a specific regulatory requirement version. This field will begin from 01 for the first version, with the next being 02, all the way up to 99. 
This field MUST be in the file and MAY be used. If this field is not used or is not applicable it SHOULD be left empty.

If and when a regulator changes the requirements for these labels, a new version of the schema will also need to 
be published.

Field: regulator_version_number

Type/Format: numeric, range(01, 99)

Examples: 01, 02, 55, 77

3. Provider Version Number

A provider may need to update a specific label due to error, new data, or other reason. In this case a version number should be incremented, with the default first version being 1. 

This field MUST be in the file and MAY be used.  If this is not used, it SHOULD be left empty.

Field: provider_version_number

Type/Format: numeric, range(01, 99)

Examples: 01, 02, 09, 18.

4. Access Network Connection Type
A provider may need to update a specific label due to error, new data, or other reason. In this case a version number should be incremented, with the default first version being 1. 

This field MUST be in the file and MUST be used. 

Field: connection_type

Type/Format: string 

Examples: fixed, mobile, satellite

5. FCC Registration Number (FRN). This is a 10-digit unique identifying number that is assigned to organizations doing business with the Commission. An organization can be issued a FRN through the FCC's Commission Registration System (CORES) or by filing FCC Form 160 [^FCCFRN]. The FRN is a required part of the label identification number (but if providers outside of the US use this schema, this field can be left empty). 
This field MUST be in the file and MUST be used by providers in the US. For providers outside of the US, it MAY be left empty.

Name: fcc_registration_number

Type/Format: numeric, range(0000000000, 9999999999)

Examples: (INSERT 3 EXAMPLES, SEPARATED BY COMMAS) 0005937974, 0003768165, TBD BY NICK

[^FCCFRN]: See https://www.fcc.gov/licensing-databases/commission-registration-system-fcc and https://www.fcc.gov/sites/default/files/form160.pdf.

6. Unique Plan Identifier (UPI). This is a combination of plan type (F or M), plus the FRN from above (up to 10 
numbers), plus an additional unique string of up to 15 characters.

The unique alphanumeric string part at the end of the UPI MUST only contain capital letters (A-Z) and numbers (0-9). 
It MUST NOT include any special characters or other delimiters such as hyphens. This part of the string is 
chosen by the provider.
This field MUST be in the file and MUST be used. For providers outside of the US, it MAY be left empty.

Name: unique_plan_identifier

Type/Format: string, limited to a maximum of 26 characters, no special characters, no delimiters, all 
letters capitalized.

Examples: F0005937974TIER1, F0005937974ABCD12341234, F0005937974ABCDEFGHIJ12345

7. Network Technology Type. This defines the access network technology used for a given BIAS offering. This is a 
numeric field using FCC-defined technology codes, limited to no more than 3 digits length. (In the future, it may be better to register these codes with IANA and to maintain them globally, rather than on a regulator-specific basis.)

* If a Fixed plan type, refer to the FCC's Fixed Technology Codes [^FCCFTC]. For example, hybrid-fiber coaxial (HFC) is "40" and fiber to the premises (FTTP) is "50".

* If a Mobile plan type, refer to the FCC's Mobile Technology Codes [^FCCMTC]. For example, 3G is "300" and 5G is "500".
This field MUST be in the file and MUST be used.

Name: network_technology_type

Type/Format: numeric, range (0, 999)

Examples: 40, 50, 500

In cases where the pricing is a combination of factors, the provider may choose to use the primary pricing type here and a qualifier in the next subsequent Price Type Details field, or may just choose Other here and define all details in Price Type Details.
It is highly recommended that the string value for this field be limited to the following options:
* Pre-Paid
* Post-Paid
* Volume-Based (example: per GB, per TB)
* Per-Line
* Per-Device (example: tablet, phone)
* Per-Location (example: per home, per office location)

43. Autonomous System Number (ASN). It may be useful to include a provider's ASN in the file. One example 
of this may be that a researcher is collecting network measurements using source IP address, which can be 
used to identify the ASN, or ASN is part of the collected data (such as related to the Border Gateway Protocol, 
BGP, for routing security to see if a Route Object Authorization, ROA, was issued), making it easy for a 
researcher to find labels based on the ASN or to combine label files with their data. 

A complicating factor can be that some ISPs have several ASNs, though often these aggregate up into one primary ASN. In other cases, small ISPs may not have their own ASN and thus may be using the ASN of their upstream provider. For these reasons, this field is considered optional. 

ASN as maintained by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). [^ASN]  In North America, these are issued by the American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN). [^ARINASN] For US ISPs, the ARIN ASN list shall be used. [^ARINlist] Until 2007, ASN were defined as 16-bit integers, which allowed for a maximum of 65,536 assignments. But the IANA is now assigning 32-bit ASNs up to 4,294,967,295. As a result this field will be numeric and limited to 10 digits in length. 
This field MUST be in the file and MAY be used. 

Name: asn

Format/Type: string, length(0,4294967295)

Examples: 7922, 14593, 701

44. Additional Terms Uniform Resource Indicator (URI). This is the URI for any additional terms and/or 
policies that may apply to a specific BIAS offering. If nothing applies, this field should be left empty. If 
multiple policies apply, then URIs MUST be separated by a semi-colon.

This field MUST be in the file and MAY be used. 

Name: uri_policy_additional_terms
 
Type/Format: identifier, uri

Examples: https://www.example.com/terms-of-service/, https://www.example.com/terms/;https://www.example.com/abuse/, https://www.example.com/anti-abuse/

45. Language. This field can optionally specify the language used in the machine-readable file. The default language shall be English. This field will use the ISO 639-3 format [^ISO639], which is a three letter format 
This field MUST be in the file and MAY be used. If it does not apply, it SHOULD be left empty.
[^ISO639]: https://www.iso.org/iso-639-language-code
Name: language
Type/Format: string, length(3)
Examples: JPN, DEU, ITA

46. Latency, Working. This is a number, in milliseconds. It latency under normal working conditions, otherwise known 
as latency under load. Depending on the type of service offered, this MAY be an absolute number or MAY be a range. If it is an absolute number, then it should generally be one to three digits. When a range is used, there MUST be a hyphen between the four numbers and MUST NOT be any spaces. If a range is used and the low and top end of the range is limited to three numbers, with a hyphen delimiter, the string is limited to 7 characters.
This field MUST be in the file and MAY be used. 
Name: latency_working

Type/Format: string, up to 7 characters

Examples: 2, 75, 500, 110-650

47. Jitter. This is a number, in milliseconds. It is the variability of working latency. Depending on the type of service offered, this MAY be an absolute number or MAY be a range. If it is an absolute number, then it should generally be one to three digits. When a range is used, there MUST be a hyphen between the four numbers and MUST NOT be any spaces. If a range is used and the low and top end of the range is limited to three numbers, with a hyphen delimiter, the string is limited to 7 characters.
This field MUST be in the file and MAY be used. 
Name: jitter

Type/Format: string, up to 7 characters

Examples: 2, 75, 500, 110-650


48. Uptime. Also known as availability, and expressed as a percentage, with a maximum of 100% that would represent 
no outage time in a typical monthly period. This is a measure of up or down status of connectivity, and is 
not intended to represent degraded service periods. 
This field MUST be in the file and MAY be used.
Name: uptime

Type/Format: numeric, range (0.0001,1.0000)

Examples: 0.9921, 1, 0.9899
